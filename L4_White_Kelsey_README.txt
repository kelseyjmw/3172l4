## Testing
Upload Image:
- tested uploading an image and adding top and bottom text then generated the meme. This is working as expected

Download Image:
- tested downloading the image after generating the meme. This is working as expected.

Random Image:
- clicking the random image button is currently causing a 404 error. I think this is an issue with
how the server is running my application on netlify. As far as I can see, all of my routing and functions
are set up correctly but the application is not finding my endpoint. Still investigating this.
